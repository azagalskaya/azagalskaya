  Polymer science is seen as key to the future, as it drives the creation of innovative materials designed to address the changing demands of both society and the environment. In collaboration with experimental research teams, our current projects focus on two primary areas:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Development of redox-mediated electrodes for oxyanions separations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Investigation degradation mechanisms in alkaline anion exchange membranes.
    </li>
  </ol>

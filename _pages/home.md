We are a computational materials research group in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Our work centers on predicting and understanding material properties for energy applications. By employing advanced simulation techniques alongside high-performance computing, we model systems under operating conditions, aiming to design the next generation of materials with improved performance and efficiency.

**Objective:** Implementation of advanced models to capture realistic behavior of electrochemical interfaces.

**Aim:** Bridge the gap between theory and experimental observations for rational design of electrocatalytic systems.

**Approach:** Integration of cutting-edge modeling techniques and data-driven methods.

**Mission:** Optimizing the performance and durability of electrochemical systems, especially at the interfaces where electrocatalytic reactions occur.
